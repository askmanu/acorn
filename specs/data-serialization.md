The XML serialization feature described in this spec has been fully implemented (Phase 2).

This is an internal implementation detail that users don't need to know about - they work with Pydantic models directly, and acorn handles XML serialization internally when communicating with LLMs.

For user-facing documentation, see [docs/module.md](../docs/module.md).
