# This file has been removed

The content previously in this spec has been implemented and is now documented in [docs/module.md](../docs/module.md).

See the following sections in the Module documentation:
- Single-Turn vs Multi-Turn
- Lifecycle Hooks (on_step, on_stream)
- History

This spec file was removed as the agentic loop feature (Phase 6) is now complete.
